This folder and subfolders contains LaTeX (.tex) files. They are compiled with [a58954].
Friendly/LaTeX/adversariallogit.tex, and Friendly/LaTeX/ensemble.tex were kept a littler shorter
than the long summaries as David Crandall recommended that some be short and others be
long. Also, an approximate 50 pages of content is a rough requirement of [dde20c].

This is the content behind my master's thesis[cfb615]. The in-text citations that you see here
are processed with InText[b8bf89]. References can be found in the "references" file. The
metadata file for InText is intextconfiguration.json. Files with InText markers can be found under
"uncited". As is usual, ^^^ was chosen for markers because it is not any language feature in
Python[fb55b2], JSON[a2a49d], CUDA C++[554041, throughout] or LaTeX[32da90] and
Biblatex[d7e76f]. All computational code runs with Chainer[170ecf] on
Python 3[fb55b2] unless otherwise noted. All .py files are written in Python 3 with the
same exception mentioned in the previous sentence.

The requirements for the manuscript part of this thesis were partially set by Professor David
Crandall. Specifically, he said
    - I can include section 3 of the manuscript with section 2 if there is a shared theme between
      them
    - Some papers' literature reviews will be short, others will be long; I can't remember which
      ones fit the former and the latter
    - To use the [11cd4d] and [d51208] templates
    - Figures count towards page length
Anything else he mentioned can be found throughout this project.
