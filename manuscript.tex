% Ben modified the value between the squiggly brackets of the commands in this section (and added
% this line and comment, as well as the section indicators enclosing this area). He also uncommented
% the \department command and removed the comment that came with that line. Capitalization style
% used here followed that of the original template.

% Originally the contents of this command said that it is a good idea to "mention the members of
% your committee here", so by including the reviewers, this recommendation is likely fulfilled.
\begin{acknowledgments}
David Crandall was the advisor of this thesis, and was helpful in many ways (including, but not
limited to, what should go into the manuscript, super accommodating when personal issues have
arisen, and general advice for thesis). He and Professor Donald Williamson (Indiana University
Bloomington) reviewed this thesis, so for that I am grateful. Sven Bambach (a postdoc at the time)
talked with me about subitization with networks, which surely helped with the thesis. And, finally,
my family, friends, and others who have helped for the general support they have provided during
what, personally, was a difficult time for the author. Thank you, everyone.

%"(optional)" in it
%\begin{dedication}
%This is the (optional) dedication page. Per Graduate School standards, this page should appear with no title and should be centered horizontally and vertically.

% Same reason as the "dedication" section above for why neutralized as comments

%This is the (optional) preface page which can be used if you wish. This page should appear after the dedication (or acknowledgements page if there is no dedication page) and before the abstract page.

% The contents that were here originally were removed and replaced with these three lines (the third
