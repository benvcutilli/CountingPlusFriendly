                                       derivative for b^a


This result can be turned into a Sigmoidal-like form (I hoped to be able to do this because
[cf158f] implies that the derivative of SoftPlus is the sigmoid function) like this:

         b^a             1                    1                 1
     ---------- = ---------------- = ------------------- = ------------                          (2)
      1 + b^a     b^(-a) (1 + b^a)   b^(-a) + b^(-a) b^a    1 + b^(-a)

This final form reduces the number of exponentiations we need to do compared to (1), so that is why
I have chosen it. Further, since [cf158f] implies that (less a constant) integrating sigmoid
results in SoftPlus, I sanity checked my derivative by comparing it to the sigmoid function. The
second derivative of Modified SoftPlus would be the derivative of (2) (not sure if I have seen a
similar derivation before -- I probably have, but I don't think I remember any of it if I did --
because it is basically the same as that of the sigmoid function's derivative):

The shape files and models can be found in ModelsAndData.zip at
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1auT4J6Jgm1yjqj1eoq1DzCbWRCyLyFMW/view?usp=sharing. The "forpaper"
and "forpaper2" folders contained images that were used in the manuscript, and their byproducts from
detection.py were also used in the paper. In the LaTeX[32da90] .tex files in the LaTeX folder,
you can see which images correspond to which model by looking at the folder name, and suffixing it
with "network"; this results in the folder for the model, and can be found in the first level of
that archive. The datasets and settings used for that model can be found in the settings.json folder
of that folder. Figures in LaTeX/figures/putasideall are based on inputs found in forpaper and
forpaper2; the former was generated with sampler.py with the --limit-scale-resampling, the latter
with without that option. The training datasets are created with important options that should
be self-evident by the dataset's folder name.
