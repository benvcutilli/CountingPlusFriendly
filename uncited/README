This folder and subfolders contains LaTeX (.tex) files. They are compiled with ^^^pdflatex^^^.
Friendly/LaTeX/adversariallogit.tex, and Friendly/LaTeX/ensemble.tex were kept a littler shorter
than the long summaries as David Crandall recommended that some be short and others be
long. Also, an approximate 50 pages of content is a rough requirement of ^^^mastersthesis^^^.

This is the content behind my master's thesis^^^cutilli^^^. The in-text citations that you see here
are processed with InText^^^intext^^^. References can be found in the "references" file. The
metadata file for InText is intextconfiguration.json. As is usual, ^^^ was chosen for markers
because it is not any language feature in Python^^^python^^^, JSON^^^json^^^, CUDA
C++^^^gpulanguage^^^ or LaTeX^^^latex^^^ and Biblatex^^^biblatex^^^. All computational code runs
with Chainer^^^chainer^^^ on Python 3^^^python^^^ unless otherwise noted. All .py files are written
in Python 3 with the same exception mentioned in the previous sentence.

The requirements for the manuscript part of this thesis were partially set by Professor David
Crandall. Specifically, he said
    - I can include section 3 of the manuscript with section 2 if there is a shared theme between
      them
    - Some papers' literature reviews will be short, others will be long; I can't remember which
      ones fit the former and the latter
    - To use the ^^^iulatex^^^ and ^^^classfile^^^ templates
    - Figures count towards page length
Anything else he mentioned can be found throughout this project.
