% This file is separate from the thesis (from a citation standpoint), and is currently unpublished,
% authored by Ben Cutilli (me) in January of 2022. * refers to things that were commented out
% due to requirements found at (i), "Required and Optional Sections". @ (throughout this file)
% refers to sizes that were modified to work within these requirements. As stated is possible in
% (ii), we don't restrict the output to one page (which is the case for résumés). Finally, any other
% commands commented out were done so so that this file can be integrated with manuscript.tex.

% Changed this file for thesis by commenting out things and changing sizes.
